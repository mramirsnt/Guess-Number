# 🎮 Guess My Number! (JavaScript Game)

This is a simple and fun number guessing game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's my **first JavaScript project**, based on a course I followed on **Udemy**, with some custom improvements I made — including playing directly by opening `index.html` in your browser.

## 🧠 How to Play

- The computer picks a random number between **1 and 20**.
- You try to guess the number by typing in your guess and clicking **Check!** or pressing **Enter**.
- You'll get feedback whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game tracks your **score**, and your **high score** is saved automatically (even after refresh!).
- Click **Again!** to restart a new round.
- Click **Reset** to clear the high score.
